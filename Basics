#To download the trimmomatic tool, we have to go to a website http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic
#Then, in the most recent Version 0.39, you will see binary, source, and manual. You will click the binary mode. It will download the zip file.
#Extract the Zip file
#There will be one jar file, which means it is a Java file, and we have to install Java too
#To download the GATK, we have to first go to the website, then https://github.com/broadinstitute/gatk/releases   then the latest GATK link will be there.
#Click the Download release: gatk-4.6.2.0.zip
#It will download the file, and we will extract the file to our desired location, for example, "/mnt/d/udemy/NGS/gatk-4.6.0.0:$PATH"

#Then
Here's an explanation of the commands related to modifying your PATH environment variable to
include the GATK tool:

1. nano ~/.bashrc
  
Purpose: Opens the .bashrc file in the Nano text editor.
.bashrc is a configuration file for Bash (your shell) that runs every time you start a new terminal
session.
Located in your home directory (~).
Why: To edit environment variables or add custom settings (like adding tools to your PATH).

2. export PATH=/mnt/d/udemy/NGS/gatk-4.6.0.0:$PATH
  
Purpose: Adds the GATK directory to your PATH environment variable.
PATH: A list of directories where your system looks for executable programs.
/mnt/d/udemy/NGS/gatk-4.6.0.0: The path to your GATK installation.
$PATH: Appends the existing PATH to retain previous entries.
What this does:
Prepends the GATK directory to your PATH, allowing you to run GATK commands (e.g., gatk
HaplotypeCaller) from any directory.
Without this, youâ€™d need to specify the full path to GATK (e.g., /mnt/d/udemy/NGS/gatk-
4.6.0.0/gatk).

control+x #to exit
  y #to save the files

3. source ~/.bashrc
  
Purpose: Reloads the .bashrc file to apply changes without restarting the terminal.
source: Executes the file in the current shell session.
Why Do This?
GATK Accessibility: After adding GATK to your PATH, you can run gatk commands globally.
Permanent Change: Modifying .bashrc ensures the PATH update persists across terminal
sessions.
